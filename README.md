# Capstone-Deep-Learning-

## Background

As someone who used to work in the service industry, it is easy for me to understand the importance of customer service and service recovery. Having such experience gave me an inspiration to apply my newly found Data Science knowledge to an industry where I used to come from.

## Problem Statement

[Research](#https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2016/07/22/4-frustrating-customer-service-experiences-and-how-to-fix-them/) shows that 60% of customers will stop doing business with a brand after just one poor customer service experience. Additionally, when it comes to reviews, the fact is that people are more likely to share their bad reviews than their good ones. However, most of these lost customers could have been retained had the problem been resolved or by providing service recovery before it is too late.

Today, I will be building a deep learning model that will help identify angry customers so that businesses will be able to take action to appease and provide service recovery to these angry customers before they leave the establishment.

### Phase 2 : Transfer Learning

#### Limitations

Time constraint: With more time, model can be trained on more epochs. However, since every epoch takes about 10minutes currently, we will be limiting our total epochs for this project to be 10.
